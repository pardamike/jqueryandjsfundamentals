# jQuery and JS Fundamentals

This tutorial will try to show you how to more effectively use jQuery and Javascript in your code, and teach some best practices. 

This tutorial assumes you know basic Javascript (and a bit of jQuery), and will not go over how to declare variables, different variable types, conditionals, loops, or other basics.

This course is designed for any developer who thinks they may have missed out on some of the fundamentals of Javascript and jQuery, or perhaps is having trouble understanding how to properly use Javascript and/or jQuery.
